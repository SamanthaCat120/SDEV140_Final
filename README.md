# SDEV140_Final
Final Project for SDEV 140 Introduction to Software Development
The Final project is supposed to be a gui application with three buttons, three labels. I chose to write a transposition program for flutes reading clarinet music or clarinets reading flute music.

This is the very beginning of this. 

To use the application, enter the notes you want transposed entered with spaces in between, and select which instrument you are playing (clarinet or flute).
